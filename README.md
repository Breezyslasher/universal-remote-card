ðŸ“¦ This repo is a fork of [tv-card](https://github.com/usernein/tv-card), which is a fork of another [tv-card](https://github.com/marrobHD/tv-card), and includes the same features and improvements usernein made, like:

- Fully functional touchpad for navigation (thanks to [iablon's Touchpad Card](https://github.com/iablon/HomeAssistant-Touchpad-Card))
- Slider for volume (thanks to [AnthonMS's Slider Card](https://github.com/AnthonMS/my-cards#slider-card))
- Much easier setup
- Implements haptic feedback
- Customizable layout, you can choose the order of the rows and buttons
- All rows and buttons are optional, you can change whatever you _(don't)_ like

Along with a few other changes/improvements:

- Supports the official [Android TV Remote integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/androidtv_remote/).
- Uses `remote.send_command` (instead of `media_player.play_media` like the original) to send commands to an Android TV using said integration, and can be given a `remote_id` to do so.
  - `media_player_id` is still present just for the volume slider. All other buttons and sources including volume buttons use the `remote_id`.
- Swipe actions are now remappable by creating `custom_keys` for `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, and `center`.
- Navigation and button behavior tweaked to mimic the Google TV remote, such as:
  - Hold press/touch/swipe actions only repeat for directional and volume keys, and perform a long press for anything else.
  - Navigation speed increased to be closer to (but not as crazy fast) as the Google TV remote.
- Row names (except for `volume_row` and `navigation_row`) can be named anything as long as it contains `_row`, giving you the option to add unlimited rows.
  - Combine this with `custom_keys` and you can really use this card for anything you want!
- Touchpad height can now be adjusted using the configuration option `touchpad_height`. If not provided will default to 250px.
- Many more default keys and sources with SVG icons if no material design icon was available in Home Assistant.
  - Not all are working or tested at this time, please let me know if you find the correct source/activity names for the ones that are incorrect.
- Send keyboard keys using `androidtv.adb_command` using the [Android Debug Bridge integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/androidtv/) and the `adb_id` configuration option.
  - Create a key titled `keyboard` to enable this and click it to open a text prompt in which you can enter text to send to your Android TV.
  - Highly recommended that you also create keys for `delete` and `enter` so you can remove and send your input text.
- Quick global search also using ADB.
  - Create a key titled 'search'. It will function similarly to keyboard entry except that it will launch a global search on close. This can also be used to send commands and queries to Google Assistant.
    Many thanks to the original authors. Getting this to work with Android TV was straightforward and all of the frontend heavy lifting they did has provided an excellent base on which to build my personal ultimate Android TV remote.

Using only these options you will get an empty card (or almost empty, if you set a title).
In order to include the buttons, you need to specify in the config the rows you want and which buttons you want in it.
You do it by declaring the rows as arrays and its buttons as values, like this:

```yaml
power_row:
  - power
media_control_row:
  - rewind
  - play_pause
  - fast_forward
```

Any name and number of rows can be added, but they must contain `_row` in their names.
The row names `volume_row` and `navigation_row` are special rows that can also be added to your remote, but they require a string as value.

| Name           | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| volume_row     | string | Can be either `slider` or `buttons`. This defines the mode you want for setting the volume (you'll see them soon below). You need to have [slider-card](https://github.com/AnthonMS/my-cards) installed in order to use `slider`. |
| navigation_row | string | Can be either `touchpad` or `buttons`. This defines the mode you want for navigating around your tv (you'll also see them soon below).                                                                                            |

## **Notice**

This card uses `remote.send_command` to send keys to the TV.

Further information on possible commands can be found on the [Home Assistant Android TV page](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/androidtv_remote/). If your TV is from another brand or simply the TV integration does not use `remote.send_command` for sending keys, you can still use this card by setting [custom buttons](#custom-buttons) with services to send keys to your TV (or do whatever you want) in your way (just like the original [tv-card](https://github.com/marrobHD/tv-card)).

## Custom buttons

If you want to add custom buttons to the remote control (of if you want to reconfigure the existing buttons), you can do it by adding an object to the `custom_keys` option:

```yaml
custom_keys:
  input_tv:
    icon: mdi:television-box
    key: KEY_TV
  browser:
    icon: mdi:web
    source: browser
  toggle_light:
    icon: mdi:lightbulb
    service: light.toggle
    service_data:
      entity_id: light.bedroom
```

The `custom_sources` exists for the same purpose, but you can use it to split the keys and sources.

```yaml
custom_keys:
  input_tv:
    icon: mdi:television-box
    key: KEY_TV
toggle_light:
  icon: mdi:lightbulb
  service: light.toggle
  service_data:
    entity_id: light.bedroom
custom_sources:
  browser:
    icon: mdi:web
    source: browser
```

Then you can easily use these buttons in your card:

```yaml
power_row:
  - browser
  - power
  - input_tv
media_control_row:
  - rewind
  - play_pause
  - fast_forward
  - toggle_light
```

<img src="assets/custom_keys.png" alt="guide" width="300"/>

With custom buttons you can override existing buttons for changing its icon or even its functionality. Here I do both:

```yaml
custom_keys:
  power:
    icon: mdi:power-cycle
    service: media_player.toggle
    service_data:
      entity_id: media_player.tv
```

Inside each button you may define `icon` and either `key`, `source` or `service`, as you've seen.

| Option       | internal function                                  | Description                                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| icon         |                                                    | The icon to show in the button. If empty, the button will be blank.                            |
| key          | `remote.send_command(command=key)`                 | The key to send to the TV via `remote.send_command`                                            |
| source       | `remote.turn_on(activity=source)`                  | The source to switch to via `remote.turn_on`                                                   |
| service      | `_hass.callService(domain, service, service_data)` | A string representing service to call. Use the format `domain.service`, e.g. `"light.turn_on"` |
| service_data | passed with `service`                              | The data to pass to the service. May be an object depending on the service you are using.      |

## Custom icons

You can customize any icon with a custom svg path using the `custom_icons` option.

Usage:

```yaml
custom_icons:
  <button>: <svg_path>
```

Example:

```yaml
custom_icons:
  hbo: >-
    M7.042 16.896H4.414v-3.754H2.708v3.754H.01L0

    0 3.872Z
```

The svg path was copied from [SimpleIcon](https://simpleicons.org/?q=hbo). Although you can use [this integration](https://github.com/vigonotion/hass-simpleicons) for using icons from SimpleIcons (there's also one for [fontawesome](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-fontawesome)).

I highly recommend using a service like [iLoveIMG Resize SVG](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-svg) to resize any icons you find to 24x24 pixels so that they render correctly.

Having defined the custom icon, you can use it on any custom button:

```yaml
custom_sources:
  max:
    icon: hbo
    source: hbomax://deeplink
```

## Keyboard input with ADB

You can use the [Android Debug Bridge integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/androidtv/) with this card to send text to your Android TV. Create a button named `keyboard` to do so. Clicking on it will create a text prompt in which you can enter the text which you wish to send. It is highly recommended that you also create keys for `delete` and `enter` so you can easily delete the text you send and quickly search using it.

```yaml
type: custom:android-tv-card
remote_id: remote.google_chromecast
adb_id: media_player.google_chromecast_adb
_row_1:
  - back
  - home
  - play_pause
_row_2:
  - volume_down
  - volume_mute
  - volume_up
navigation_row: touchpad
touchpad_height: 370px
_row_3:
  - delete
  - keyboard
  - enter
```

<img src="assets/keyboard_keys.png" alt="keyboard example" width="300"/>

Similarly, you can use ADB to do quick global Google Assistant searches by creating a button named `search`, which will function in a similar manner but will search immediately after sending the text.

## Installation

### Step 1

Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), open it, click on Frontend, click on the three dot menu in the top-right corner, click on Custom repositories, paste the URL of this repository in the repository field, and set the category to Lovelace.

### Step 2

Add a custom element in your `ui-lovelace.yaml`

```yaml
type: custom:android-tv-card
remote_id: remote.google_chromecast
media_player_id: media_player.google_chromecast
power_row:
  - power
channel_row:
  - channel_up
  - info
  - channel_down
apps_row:
  - netflix
  - youtube
  - spotify
volume_row: slider
navigation_row: touchpad
source_row:
  - return
  - home
  - source
media_control_row:
  - rewind

### Extra

In any row, if you add an empty item, there will be an empty/invisible button filling the space:

```yaml
source_row:
  - return
  - home
  - source
media_control_row:
  - rewind
  -
  -
  - fast-forward
```
